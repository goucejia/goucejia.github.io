## Hello! Welcome to Yu' homepage! ☃️


I am Yu Fang, a reseacher interested primary in Natural Language Processing and Maching Learning fields. My current work is about the interpretability of language models on NLP applictaions, and the human-centered intersection of cognitive science and computer science. I'm also interested in trustworthy language models and AI for social good.

I obtain my MS degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/cs), [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), and I'm lucky to advised by Professor [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/).
